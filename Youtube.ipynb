    "# YouTube Recommendations by Using Deep Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Users:\n",
    "\n",
    "YouTube is a platform which serves 3 types of users:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Creators to share their content & earn royalties\n",
    "2. Watchers to discover and enjoy content they like\n",
    "3. Businesses to advertise their products to watchers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Measure the success of the recommendation engine:\n",
    "\n",
    "CTR of home page - videos watched from the options on the home page \n",
    "\n",
    "% of videos watched and liked from the home page recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "Explicit feedback mechanisms on YouTube: thumbs up/down, in-product surveys, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implicit feedback such as a user completing a video is a positive example\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "During development, the authors make extensive use of offline metrics (precision, recall, ranking loss, etc.) to guide iterative improvements to our system. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the final determination of the effectiveness of an algorithm or model, the authors rely on A/B testing via live experiments. In a live experiment, they measure subtle changes in click-through rate, watch time, and many other metrics that measure user engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Recommender Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Overview of Paul Covington, Jay Adams, and Emre Sargin’s 2016 paper “Deep Neural Networks for YouTube Recommendations”: https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/45530.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "It is one of the first papers to highlight the advancements that Deep Learning may provide for Recommender Systems,\n",
    "\n",
    "YouTube’s recommender systems were run by Google Brain that was later opensourced by Google as TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of Youtube's recommendation system is to put fresh and relevant content to their users. YouTube recommendations are responsible for helping more than a billion users discover personalized content from an ever-growing corpus of videos. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges \n",
    "\n",
    "YouTube’s corpus is constantly changing, and they aren’t in control of the content being added.\n",
    "\n",
    "YouTube has one of the largest and most advanced recommendation systems in the industry. YouTube is slightly different than other services that utilize recommendation systems(i.e Netflix, Hulu, Spotify) because users upload thousands of hours of video to the platform every second. This creates the need for a robust model that can handle constant incoming data and will output quality recommendations in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal: Make personalized recommendations from a very large corpus (millions) of videos\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### System Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/susanqisun/DAV6300/main/Screen%20Shot%202021-03-18%20at%2012.09.43%20PM.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The system is comprised of two neural networks: one for candidate generation and one for ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Candidate Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "The `candidate generation` network the huge corpus containing billions of videos as input and gives out a few hundred videos as an output that are considered for user recommendation. It takes events from users YouTube history. The network aims for accuracy and relevance. This can only provide broad personalization using collaborative filtering. The similarity between users compared by identifiers such as IDs of video watches, search query tokens\n",
    "and demographics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Architecture:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors experiment with different networks, varying from one layer to four layers deep.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/susanqisun/DAV6300/main/Screen%20Shot%202021-03-18%20at%201.05.24%20PM.png\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The article give a good explanation on this model: https://towardsdatascience.com/using-deep-neural-networks-to-make-youtube-recommendations-dfc0a1a13d1e\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\"This model is trained using `negative sampling`, where we attempt to reinforce negative results by only propagating a subset of these negative examples rather than all, and aim the relation between negative examples to reinforce this correlation. At serving time, an approximate nearest neighbors algorithm is used to serve the top N results in sub-linear time.\" (https://towardsdatascience.com/how-youtube-recommends-videos-b6e003a5ab2f)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative sampling: one of the candidate sampling algorithms, which will make the results highly dependent on\n",
    "the choice of sampling distribution. (https://www.tensorflow.org/extras/candidate_sampling.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 The Ranking Network\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part of the recommendation system involves ranking videos. In order to recommend quality content, YouTube needs a way to determine which content users are watching and enjoying.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Architecture:**\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/susanqisun/DAV6300/main/Screen%20Shot%202021-03-18%20at%201.24.30%20PM.png\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The user input in the ranking network basically comprises of two behaviours:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Users' engagement behaviour that is collected from clicks and watches\n",
    "\n",
    "- Degree of satisfaction that is gathered by likes, dislikes, dismissals, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ranking network assigns a score to each video according to a desired objective function using a rich set of\n",
    "features describing the video and user. The highest scoring videos are presented to the user, ranked by their score. It must be noted that user feedback is part of both the networks and is a more important criteria for this network. The degree of relevance on the other hand holds less weightage in this network, than the candidate generation network.\n",
